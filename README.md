## IMPORTANT UPDATE
On 11th November 2020 Notion team released an update that implemented a more advanced version of this extension inside Notion. This is amazing news :-) It also makes this extension no longer necessary.

## What is it?
Chrome Extension that makes viewing Notion database pages better!

It auto-hides page properties list that often pushes down the page content.

## How it works?
By default list of properties is collapsed:             |  Clicking on the bar opens/hides the list of properties:

## How to install?
1. Download the whole repo as Zip file (see green button "Code" in top right of this page)
2. Open Chrome Extension chrome://extensions
3. Enable "Developer Mode" (top right)

5. Drag & drop the unzipped folder into Chrome extensions window

## Safety
This is a simple extension with <2 pages of code. You can read it entirely to make sure it is safe. 
PS. I include official copy of jQuery library as I didn't figure out how to reference it via URL in the manifest file.

## Notice
I wrote it in an afternoon for myself and sharing with the community. It is not affiliated with Notion the company.
